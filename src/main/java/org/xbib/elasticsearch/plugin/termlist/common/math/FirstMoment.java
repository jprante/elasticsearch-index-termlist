/**
 * Computes the first moment (arithmetic mean).  Uses the definitional formula:
 *
 * mean = sum(x_i) / n
 *
 * where <code>n</code> is the number of observations.
 *
 * To limit numeric errors, the value of the statistic is computed using the
 * following recursive updating algorithm:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Initialize <code>m = </code> the first value</li>
 * <li>For each additional value, update using <br>
 *   <code>m = m + (new value - m) / (number of observations)</code></li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * Returns <code>Double.NaN</code> if the dataset is empty.
 *
 * <strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong> If
 * multiple threads access an instance of this class concurrently, and at least
 * one of the threads invokes the <code>increment()</code> or
 * <code>clear()</code> method, it must be synchronized externally.
